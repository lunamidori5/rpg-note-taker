  For those taking notes, please fully parse this upcoming text and record based on your perspective. For those players in the call, welcome my friends! Um, so, you two are both in your rooms, Genova and, or not, yeah, Genova, Genesis, and Onake. What are you all doing? I fall out of bed again. You successfully fall out of bed. Okay. Anaké, what are you doing? I'm gonna go over and stare at the wall for like about a minute. You should greet the wall. Okay. You successfully stare at the wall Anaké. How do you spell an okay? Somebody is clicky-clackety-clicky-clackety. How do you spell an okay? O-N-A-G-I. If you just want to mute up, uh, K-Bellashi for now. Hello. Testing, testing. Hello. Welcome. Good morning, Genova. Everybody else just woke up. Um, you, you all, uh, hear the bustle of the tavern outside of your door. Well, the upstairs outside of your doors. Um, what do you all do? I'm not back in my room am I? You're back in your room. After what happened Medical Bay? Uh, well it's been a week or more than a couple days. Remember that time in this campaign moves in real time. Okay. First thing I'm gonna do, after my shower and getting dressed and all that, making sure that my shirt is properly ripped in the appropriate areas. I like crop tops and I don't like sleeves, sue me. By the way, while you were going amongst your week, they gave you a training katana. And you picked it up very much so, because mommy came and showed you some secrets of the katana. By the way, I can confirm the crop top thing. The man only wears tank tops in real life. Well, I have a reason not to. Okay. Just a friendly reminder to those that have them, I recommend you putting on your robes. Oh, yeah, I'm going to put on the robes. Awesome. All right. You all hear some chitter chatter from this tavern above. Question. Answer. Do I have robes or do I not? You were given some robes. The simulation overseer gave you some robes. Can I re-stitch those robes into a stylish gothic trench coat? No. No? No. You need platforms to wear a trench coat, my dude. No, I don't. I'm rebuilding my- You could make it open up from the front, but doing that would cause it to have half efficiency, so it wouldn't be as efficient in protecting you from the reality angers. Okay, when you say robes, are you talking like bath robes or kimono robes? I was thinking more like Jedi, but yeah, that's a good question. Yellow? I'm looking at a picture of them. I'm looking up a picture of them because it seems as though it's necessary just one second Hey, kaboche. Oh, no, never mind Do I have a picture of these rooms oh Gosh my poor computer Used to running on the laptop Here is that's that's a standard dress. That's not even like Uh, do I have a photo of these rubs? Oh no! They got lost to time! I only have pictures of Lady Light! Oh no. I'll take em! I'll take your entire stock! Alright, well I'll have to look up pictures later. Um. Dammit, Julian, stop being gay. So you all here talking in the tavern above, what would you all like to do? For the sake of argument, do my ropes have sleeves? Yes, absolutely. Now take the sleeves off. That will make them less efficient and cause you to not be able to cast magics. You can always roll them up. Right? The whole point is for them to cover your body so you can use magic since that well, in the reality anchor, that's the point of them. Fine, I'll toss them over my shoulder in case I need them. Okay. But I'm going to go find Leigh and White. Okay, so you head up to the tavern? Sure, I'll look there first. Okay, what about the other two players? or like a Nakaian Genesis. What are you all doing? I'm going to get my do I still have my sword, my gear? Your I believe your sword is in the simulation. I don't have like a physical one. I don't think you have a physical one. No, dang, OK. Not yet. Also, your your BBC, Genova is just sitting in the corner of your room. But you can't equip it right now. All right. All right. Anake, what are you doing? What are you saying? I'm in my past. Can I investigate it? Investigate what? The wall. Yes, you can investigate the wall. Roll investigation check. I didn't finish saying... Oh, go ahead. What's up? Um... I need to think. Yeah. I guess I'm just going to go up to the tavern and join Genova. All right. All right, O'Nough. OK, what are you investigating? I said the wall and the three. It's a nice wall. You see the you see the beautiful wallpaper. It looks like it's been freshly cleaned, actually. What, um, like, pattern is it? It's like a golden blue, so it's blue with like golden leaf accents. It's very pretty. It looks like Astrologian, so like, uh, like star patterns and, and, uh, like, symbolism. Um, I'm just gonna say, what's going on? What's going on with you? You've been quiet for a couple of days. No response. It doesn't say anything back. Do you go up to the tavern? I crossed my arms and well actually first off I'll go and put on my robe since that's what's going on and then I'll go ahead and cross my arms and head out the door. Alright, you head out the door, you three see each other walking up the hallway. As you get there, your favorite simulation overseer is sitting at the bar drinking what appears to be some weird black and like reddish liquid. You can see a IPTK ad next to her cup. It says, like, Green Bull or something. And it's, like, tipped over. And she looks mentally and physically exhausted. I see Lady Light in the room. No. I'm gonna approach the overseer. Alright. I simply go. Do you happen to know where my wife is? Also, you might want to get a shower. You. You look like shit. Excuse you friend. There's a young in- I'm going to get in a place- There's a young in Nepal. Right, right, my bad. It happens, it's okay, I understand. She looks at you, she looks at you and she's like... I would like to clarify that the latest poem is very playful and less insulting. Absolutely. She looks at you and she goes... Well, I'm sorry. Uh-huh. Yeah, you don't have to make the two hour trek from the surface every time you come in here. I'm staying here tonight. I Had a question. I was doing some research into 6858 and why she's attacking everybody And we think that one of the photoners is actually causing issues with her and She puts like this huge notebook down and she goes I I believe that Margarita might be causing issues again. I'm going to take a deep breath and look at the overseer and go. So you think that thing is either working for or is one of these photoners? No, I think the photoners are actively causing her to like glitch out of reality is my theory. By the way, at the same time that all of this is happening, the barkeep is getting drinks ready and breakfast or slash dinner ready. The bar keep puts onakes favorite meal and a glass of chocolate milk down. And before nebula, they put a massive pint of a massive pint of their favorite their favorite drink. I'm referring to Genesis. Um, and they put down this really hearty meal of like, uh, eggs, sausage, bacon, and just like this really like hearty meal in front of Genesis. For Genova, they slide her a, uh, a regular hot like coffee. Continue, Genova? I make a thank you motion to the barkeep before looking back to the overseer. So you think this creature is a marionette for these O-Toners to manipulate? No. Um, because I was- You were saying something on Aki? She looks over to Anakai? Oh, yeah. I had a question about, like, um, who had a form of taunters again? Exactly. They are beings that are capable of controlling a certain dimension. Wait, so we... oh, okay, so Luther's a photo-tauner? Yes, Luther is the photo-tauner of time. Okay, I was... I just... I just see you asking this a million times. How do you spell that? Luther? No, for Tauner. Oh, it's, here we go. I feel like I'm going to be saying that a lot. All right, so she picks up the journal and puts it in her robes and she goes, if you would like, I'd like to enter the simulation and see if we can just find more information. I can't promise that there'll be excitement, but if there is, are you all ready for that in case? Rolling my eyes and chugging the coffee, I look at the overseer and go, yeah, I mean, that sounds fun. If you don't mind, I'm gonna make a detour and grab my wife and her sister first. Uh, I believe that Miss Lady Light might be in physical therapy right now. You can check the medical wing. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. I need to talk to the doctor about something anyway. The doctor forgot to take notes. No, go ahead. Take the final swing out of my mug, whatever you want to call it. Smack it back on the table and go, I'm going to join you. Alrighty, you declare that you're going to join Genova. What's Anake doing? I'm gonna join but I'd like to see if somebody else could come. Alright, who would you like to bring? I'm saying this just for the humor. I'm bringing them just because it's kind of funny to me and also they seem like they'd be doing it for the meme. Nice to have in the party Persona of Fire Eyes. The simulation overseer looks at you and smiles and goes, I think she'd like a good outing. I agree with that. As she walks over to the doorway and scans her badge, you see the keypad appear and she hits the code for Fire and Ice. Firenice uses the same icon as Genova. Can I make a perception check? Uh, yeah. To see if I can see the code. Yeah, sure. Go for it. I want to find out some numbers, baby. What's the AC here? Uh, what did you roll? It's loading. I just want to know, like, anything less than the 1220. Just tell me what you roll. More or less kind of like a dynamic. That's fair. I do not have. 17. Plus my perception. That's a dirty 20. Dirty 20? Yeah. You see the code for Fire and Ice's room. Can you message that to me? No, it's just you know the code now. Oh, you're never gonna like quiz me on it? Nope. I removed that because tracking all those numbers was unfun for everybody. That's fair. So I removed the having to track those types of numbers at all. All right. I have a question. Yes? Did I notice? Uh, well, if you want to, yeah, sure. No, I'm asking like, did I notice Genesis trying to do to figure out what the code was? I mean, sure, I guess. I wasn't being subtle about it. Yeah, they weren't being, uh, they weren't being stealthy about it. I know, I didn't make a stealth check, so, yeah. I can say your passive let you see that. Yeah, absolutely, you notice that. I just look over at Jenna's. Jenna's just staring at the overseer. What a flat-pain look. I mean, Jenna! As you all... I guess. As you all... enter her room, it's kind of warm in her room, really. It's quite toasty. It's gonna be a bad. But it seems to cool down once you enter the room. And I immediately go to the medical wing. Yes after we grab a lady fire and ice. It was requested that we grab one of the personas. I know, but... We'll go there straight after Genova, you don't have to fuss. The simulation ever seeer looks at you and goes, listen, I know you're madly in love. We'll make it quick. It's not just that, I think I found a way to help her. who heal her. Alright. You've piqued my interest, Genova. I will... They will expedite your trip in just a moment. Miss Fire and Ice. Let me go and get some. As you say that, she is already starting to pull out her badge, and she... you notice her punching the door for the medical wing, and she goes, go ahead. Miss Fire and Ice, are you available for an outing today? As the door clicks into place and Genova runs through the door. Genova, you are now no longer in the scene. You are in the medical wing talking to the doctor and I'm going... You don't mind, I'm going to just sit here and take notes, but specifically from Genova's perspective. Of course, I was expecting from Genova's perspective. I don't know if you can hear it, but I've been typing solidly for about five minutes. Yeah. Uh, so, lady, uh, Lady Fire and Ice, I need to pull up her info. Um, oh yeah, this individual. Um, Lady Fire and Ice goes, absolutely, I would love to go on an outing. I, uh, have been cooped up for a while. Also, what's her problem? Is she okay? pointing towards the door. I turn around and look at him. What? Who are you talking about? It looks like the half-dressed woman ran out of the room. You talking about Jin Hova? Oh, yes. Yeah. She seemed in quite a hurry. Maybe we should follow her? Wait, didn't you know of a meat personifier on ice? You never gave her your name. Yeah, I did. Did you? I did the full introduction with the curtsy. Did I lose those notes? You might have noticed. I took notes. Oh, in your little introduction thing. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, we'll rewind the scene a little bit and she'll go, is DeNovo okay? She seemed in quite a rush. Maybe she's checking on the others. Oh yeah, she went home. Dismissively, that one's just being a love bird. She kind of chuckles. The simulation overseer says, come on, let's go for a quick outing. As Fire and Ice follows you in tow, you all enter the medical wing. You all see a massive room with a bunch of beds and chairs. Each bed has like a divider on the left and right and back of it with like medical equipment. There's about 25 chairs up front for people to sit in, 10 of them facing the door, 10 of them facing the beds. And you see in one of the bed areas, uh, Jenova and Lady Light and one of the staff. And the doctor goes to Genova. Yes, I know. I have this marked down and you've showed me this earlier this week. I know that it might be helpful for her, But is it okay with your health to do, to use this... Magics? I do not know. I actually had an idea to propose if Wifi would like to come with us into the simulation. Should we encounter any enemies, I want to see if she can drain them while holding a crystal for herself. or if it's just because of some form of metaphysical connection to me that I don't understand. Oh yeah, that reminds me. Oh, sorry, you can finish that. I didn't mean to interrupt. No, I said what I wanted to say. Oh, okay, sorry. Can I check my pockets and see if that stone was there and my shot glass was gone? There is no stone in your pocket and you have a shot glass in your pocket Okay Quite intriguing. Can I make oh? There's no mana check is there? all right, so as You as you explain this to the doctor they say You have as long as you have consent from the individual to test on them Genova that it is perfectly fine and That you should you know be safe in any testing or anything that you do Luna Yes, could I make an arcana check into this theory? Absolutely DC 55 I I rolled a one. You think it's for sure going to work. You honestly believe that with 100% of your soul. Okay. All right. What are y'all doing? Wait, even if I rolled a 20, you would have told me. What are y'all doing? She lights like sitting there like she has like a rubber band on her arm. On her weak arm, her left arm, she has like a rubber band going up to her shoulder and it's just laying there. And the assistant's like, okay, now try to lift it. And nothing's happening. I look at you Nova darling. What do you think of my idea? The fact that you're looking at yourself, I'm assuming you went up to like a mirror to look at yourself Oh, I like to say I look at lady light Okay as she goes I Am willing to try anything For you just get me out of this ridiculousness Of course! Would you want me to carry you again? That is up to you. Alright. I'd grab her crutch with my tail and pick her up, Rytal-style. She still has all the rubber bands and stuff attached to her, and the assistant looks at you and goes, Are you taking her? And the simulation overseer goes, Absolutely, on the request of the overseers. She's going for an outing. I look down and ask, do you want me to remove the rubber bands or? I did. I did ask you to get me out of the situation. So yes, please. I'm going to remove the rubber bands and then I'm going to walk over the door. You take the one off her left arm and the one off her left leg. It kind of snaps and you see her kind of wins a little bit. But other than that, she looks fine. She's in her beautiful purple outfit that she usually has on for these types of things. I am posting a photo of her. Yeah, those are rare. I'm going to walk over the door and impatiently just kind of pace in front of it, debating on whether or not to just put in the code for the simulation room, if I know it. What am I looking at with these photos? You click on them and she's in the photo. Oh, okay. Oh, what is our P? I don't know how you can... Uh, I hacked Final Fantasy 14 and posed her with, like, if you look, even her eye is correct. Every detail about this is correct. She's actually hacking a triple A MMMO. Well, the game engine's very easy to get into. Yeah. It doesn't make any client side checks. OK, so. Go ahead, OK, ask your question. What what exactly was your idea again? Junova. I possess a supply of magic crystals, all of them with different elements. I learned recently that if I offer an element to a persona that matches what they control and they make physical contact with me, they can drain whatever energy magic I have stored in myself as well as apparently parts of my own life force to heal and empower themselves. As you're saying this, the simulation ever seers pulling out her notebook and taking notes. Well, specifically in the case of my darling here in my arms, she can heal and regain the ability of her body. In the case of Lady of Persona Wynne, she just gets more crazy. I learned that the hard way. Yeah, speaking of which her room fell out of the sky and Got destroyed and she destroyed like half of the town I apologize it was quite funny really to be honest wait Lady wins She hit the four corners the room destroyed them go ahead Genesis I'm sorry I can't hear you that would happen to be the the town that hates us right um no okay anyways um I just had a small question question is it illegal to share notes? No. Alright. Alright, the simulation ever seen here. You want access to my notes? You got a DM me because I'm effectively writing my character's diary here. So you all see if the simulation ever seen her walks over to the door scans her badge and she presses unknown buttons to you all because when you all scan your badge these buttons don't appear. Perception check? Yeah you see these unknown buttons you can't read them. I well what are they what do they look like are they inscribed with a language I can't read? They are inscribed with some kind arcane language that as you try to look at it the characters move. Okay. Can I see which button? Yeah, these are buttons that are never there. Like they spawned in after the fact. 1118. Huh? Yeah, I'm telling you, I'm explaining it to you. You see these extra buttons appear under the panel and it's like 20 more buttons appear because she scanned her badge and she's an overseer. Well, I can't read them, but like I can see the sequence and then she presses them, correct? Yes, but you're aware of when you scan your badge, only nine buttons appear. I know that. So she just reaches down and presses one button. And you can't read that button. And I can't read it, but I know which one she pressed. Yes. Okay. You see as the door latches, and then it does the whole loading thing. and it changes colors and she opens it. And you're in a bigger, what appears to be a bigger simulation room, what we can affectionately call the six person simulation room. And there are six headsets. There are five on the ground that are black with tethered. Tether's going up to the ceiling. These stones have three buttons on the front. Um, and there are massive stones on the wall in front of each one, uh, that appear to be on swivels. There is a white one in a chair, um, facing the others. And the simulation ever seeer goes after you all. What are we doing here? Going for an outing. Besides going into the simulation, of course. We're looking into Margarita today and we're going to see if she is the reason for 6858's erratic behavior because according to every note that the foundation has on 6858, she is nonviolent. Are you saying we're wasting away again, Mark? No. I won't make that. That's stupid. Walk me into the simulation room, I look down at Lady Light and go... I want you to stay close to me. Oh, absolutely. Your movement speed is reduced to 20. Wallace, you are helping Lady Light move. But... You forcibly get moved on Lady Light's turn, and Lady Light forcibly gets moved on your turn. Okay. So, I will adjust this so that you are in fact tethered together. You mean effectively a movement speed of 60? No, it's effectively a movement speed of 40. I have a question about... It's 20 per, but anyway. It's 20 per. Both of your movement speeds have been changed to 20. For Genova, your movement speed has been decreased to 20. For Lady Light, her movement speed has been increased to 20. Go ahead and okay. About the simulation, does Lady Light regain control of her limbs in the simulation or no? No, not normally. Therefore we're here to do, if I've been listening correctly, my lips should say. Okay. As you all put on your headsets, I need to know who's in what order. Ladyfire goes and goes all the way onto the end to the fifth person, and Ladylight kind of hobbles over near her, and I'm assuming Genova goes next. So Onake or Genesis, who's in first and second spot? I'll take the last one. So the second spot? I'll take which I'll pick the last pick, head side. That's... Okay, Genova or not Genova. Genesis, what you doing? Which one you pickin'? Call me Nova for short. Um... Sorry, I'm trying to find you a better icon at the same time. What are we asking about? Uh, okay. You grab the first headset. Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll take that. Alrighty. So all of you put on your headsets and you awaken in the... You waken in the simulated simulation. Alright you are outside of turn order, what would you like to do? Before you, you all see a massive house. For some strange reason, all of you feel very small, as if everything around you is extra big. Can I make a perception check into why I feel that way? Uh, yeah, absolutely. You can roll for it or I can use your passive. No, I'll roll for it. Okay, go for it. If I roll for it and I get say default to my passive. It's up to you. Or do I have to take the two? It's up to you. All right. It's 19. OK, yeah. You think it might be because everything is actually just bigger here. There we go. OK. I got everybody's character sheets open now. Head open, lady fires. I opened Hero 4. I'm going to make you a better icon than Venti with a shotgun. Oh, wait. Can we change our icons? Oh. Yes, you don't actually have one. So I've just been randomly generating photos of Carly and Luna for you. You just need to send me a different token. I sent her a picture of Venti with a shotgun as a joke. What are you all doing? and use it for the no-go. Let's not work on tokens right now. This is a, that is an out of session activity. Yeah. Can I motion the overseer closer to me and Leading Light? Yeah, she comes over. I would like to try and I deal with you. I'm going to take out a white crystal and hand it to the overseer and go, now, try to hand that to my beloved here. So the lady like to lean on before taking step back. She looks and she goes, I do not consent to being tested on at this time. Just because I need my strength in case we get attacked. Because I don't want her hurt or any of you hurt, but especially her. Because she seems to be getting injured at an extremely high rate inside of this simulation. I hope you can understand. I'm going to do some more work here. I'm going to look to everyone else. Does anyone else want to give this a shot? I pull out my sword, Belmung. You don't have that. You just have a standard sword. I don't have this sword. We're in this thing. Okay. Wait, does Genesis not get the God sword I gave her? I gave her they will have to they will have to earn that via doing good notes. Okay. I was just pulling out a sword named though. I wasn't thinking. Oh, okay. Yeah, absolutely. And by the way, all of your weapons support crystals now. Yeah, I wanted to mention that earlier in the in the thing was that these crystals for for some reason are also what generates my weapon's ability to control wind. Just letting you know, I've changed the crystals massively. They are completely different crystals. You can slot any color of crystal and get that element in your blade. The only reason you used wind before is because you used the crystals that were meant for species buffs. But they no longer give species buffs, they're just elementally aligned crystals now. Hey, pause, both of you. Genesis, I massively changed the crystals to make it more fitting to to Genova's character. They now are elementally aligned crystals. So if Genova consumes a blue crystal, she outputs ice. My sword will become fire. Yes. Yes. Okay. A green crystal will let you do wind damage, et cetera. etc. Would you like my wind chain saw? All right So jenova hands jenova hands genesis a light crystal Now try to hand that to my beloved after that I will give you a different I will give you a crystal clear play. I was about to slide it in the sword. Thank you for clarifying No, no, I'm trying to test an idea here, please I mean, it's also fitting because if she's draining my life force I am the tank, but um anyways, I'm going to end the crystal to lady late. Okay, uh, as you do make a constant. What did you say, Anake? I'm sorry. I'd like to step back. Okay. Yeah, you successfully step back. I don't think it will be explosive. I think she's just gonna drain. I need you to make a constitution saving throw Genesis with extreme diss, er, supreme disadvantage. Also um, okay I get a plus one on saves too. Yes. How many dice is that? Four. Four. I thought extreme was four and supreme was five. is for I miss said supreme I rolled the one it's all no I rolled a few I rolled a two so let's do one more you rolled a natural one I rolled a net one yes okay not ones override everything that one is a critical fail always fails you can't add a modifier to a net one all right how much HP do you have yeah you take you You take 3,000 points of damage. Are you okay? 140. So, you all see as Lady Light touches and then like a flash of light happens and you see a normal Lady Light like just leaning against her crush, leaning against Genova. I would say I'm now down on a knee. You you are not prone, but you look you look you look substantially weaker. I'm not saying for the effect. I was actually just doing it for the roleplay, but OK. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. If you want to roleplay it, but I for very important reasons, you are not considered a prone. Yes. If I say I go down on the I don't want it to be considered prone. I just mean for the roleplay Are you okay? How do you feel I Feel a little bit. I'm rated but They do not carry the The amount of power in which I was able to consume last time. Oh, it feels like someone just... Okay, so you can take from everyone else, but it's... would you say diminish or lesser than when you take from me? I've only accidentally took from you once, so I don't know. By the way, you see her eye in particular, her her left eye look up and look past you all and she goes we have company which side is unusable I forget you notice that she looked with her left eye and then her right eye is just glazed over like looks like it's blind Okay. Okay. So the thing with the brain that I'm pretty sure is what goes on is that the left side of the brain controls the right half of the body and no, that's not how brains work. That is how brains work, but that's not that's not the situation in which she finds herself in. She has a very bad case of Katar's syndrome. I'll explain that later to you because you all see if you're a TLDR. I'll hold the link and check. Give me a second. Um, by the way, you all see his four guards are approaching you from the massive one story building. OK, looking over to Genesis, I'm going to ask, are you going to be OK or do I need to heal you? Well, um, Lady light reaches out with her good hand. I'm doing something in character. Can I tell you know the numbers or like you I need to. You don't know the numbers. OK, you just know you're extremely weak. But as she does, as as you say that, Lady light just quietly reaches out with her right hand and touches you very gingerly as she heals you for seven thousand damage. No cry? Oh, I'm sorry. That number was wrong. It's 15,000 damage now. That's even worse. Um, Gray, really quick, I am linking you. There's the thing if you want to read it. Um, oh yeah that. She's now down a lily, okay. So, alright. I'm gonna stand close to Lady Light before tossing Genesis. Hey, let's see. Are these guards human looking? Yes, they look like human females. Do they have faces? Yes, they have normal, everyday faces. Okay. Seeing as they're human, I'm gonna toss Genesis a red crystal for her sword. Okay, sure. I have no idea what this does. Let's find out. I'm gonna slant it in. Your sword becomes fiery. Nice. I'm then going to pull out a white crystal and charge it into myself. Uh, okay, you now make sure you track that on your character sheet. You now do light damage. You don't gain the AoE until you're at two stacks. I know. I know. That I'm doing like fire damage or? I do not want to add the elemental gauge to your character sheet. You can, but it would take me about two hours to add that to your character sheet. So not right now. Not right now, please. Um, just make sure make a note on it on like a paper or something for this session I've made a note All right, they approach you all And one of them steps forward And She goes Welcome, adventurers. There seems to be a... There seems to be a uptick of adventurers today. How can we help you at the manner today? I sheathed Belmung and we have come from a far place and I turned to Genova, I don't know what I'm doing here. The simulation goes, we are here to investigate the recent bug problem. And all of the guards look at each other and go right this way, Inventures. Do you all follow them? Sure. And I will follow the rightmost guard specifically. Okay. I'm going to follow them, but I'm going to make sure me and the two personas stay farther back in case things go south. Oh, absolutely. I totally get that. So you all move 20 feet at a time. They just kind of inner chatter while you all chatter. I'm going to give you all three actions by the time you get up to the stairs. All right. Can I ask them some questions? They look at you and they go, absolutely ask away, my friends. So you are aware of the bug problems? Yes, we have bug problems inside of the manor. What are bug problems? They are massive, like very fast reproducing bugs. They, you'll hear them when you fight. Like if they attack, you'll hear them. We've lost most of our, we've lost most of the household to these very weird, extremely fast repopulating bugs. We've tried poisons, we've tried everything, we just can't get them to die. Side note, due to the fight with Margarita, am I still afraid of bugs? Yes! Okay. And I'm still afraid of unicorns. Yep. That's okay. We don't see as many of those. Yeah. Alrighty. What do you all want to do? You see an open door before you. Going into what they affectionately have been calling the manor. Well, since Genova is absolutely terrified of bugs and... Genova? Genova? Genesis, sorry, brain. The G's and the J's and the... Again! Call me Nova for short. You can use Nova and Genesis. Okay. Okay, since Genesis is absolutely terrified of bugs and Nova, it's okay. Did I call your character that? Yeah, go ahead. And Nova is like taking care of Lady Light. I'm going to go for, I'm going to go through the front door, basically. Okay, you go through the front door. You just let yourself in. You see a big dining room area. It has a nice table, has a beautiful window. You see some stairs, like half, like a, like just like two or three stairs going up into a kind of upper level bedroom, but it's not really upper level, it's the same like level. You see access to the kitchen and you see a back door that's also open for what you might assume as like some like airflow reasons. You also see some stairs off to the right of what appears to be a living room and there's a couple people in there. Do I see any bugs or can I roll like an investigation on that? Everybody can roll a perception check. Okay. Wait, you never asked me what I wanted to do during those three actions. I'm going to let you, don't worry. Okay. You also want me to roll perception? Yes, roll perception. Okay. All right, mate. Do the funny. All right, what did everybody get? One at a time, please. Oh, man. 18. Okay. I don't know what I'm saying. Uh, yes. Perception. 18. Acknowledged. Onake. Uh, Mikki. You all hear some buzzing in the background. Alright, Jenova, what would you like to do? Um, turning to look at the two personas that are walking... You only see one. You only see the one next to you. Who's missing? It appears as though Lady Fire and Ice kind of just went off and did her own thing. Okay. Lady Light like leans over to you and she says, let her. He is still young. I was gonna ask you both what your thoughts on this whole situation are, but I guess you're the only one here to ask, Wifey. Well, and Genesis is right there too. But I feel like this is gonna be a fun little adventure. I heard that bugs are weak to light damage. Well, let me know if you start feeling weak again. Can I charge another light crystal? I... I don't think you will. That will do damage to an ally near you. A second light crystal will? Yes. I believe Genova is in range. Or not Genova, Genesis is in range of your light crystal. I was gonna say, would it... How could it damage Lady Light if she is light? It's up to you if you want to. I can. before charging the crystal I'm gonna inform the party that I am going to start charging more magics. okay you you form the party I'll give Genesis one turn to get out of the way. I'm not informing can I get the heck out of dodge. that's too big why is that so big? Oh, because I typed in 15, not 5. Oop. Alright, you're actually not in range. You managed to step out of the way and it doesn't hit you. Alright. Um, Genesis and Genova and Onaka, you all have two turns left. What would you like to do? Walking up, uh, walking forward, I turn around offering my hand to Lady Light. Would you care to join me, Madame? She's already, like, leaning over you and you have her arm across your shoulders. Oh. Oh. Cause you've been literally holding her up. The simulation overseer is going to come over here. Well I thought I'd let her go once she, uh, drained from, uh, Genesis. No. Uh, she, nothing happened when she drained from Genesis. Like, there was no change. But you said there was a flash of light. Yes, there was a flash of light as she consumed it. But she did not drain the light magic from the crystal to heal herself? She did, but it didn't do anything to her as far as you could see. Okay. You did not make that as clear to me. I do apologize. It's very hard to make these types of things extremely clear. I will try to do better, my friend. Um, what would you what would you do? What would you all like to do? Leading lady light inside I'd like to cast kinetic jaunt on myself That will um I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna let you I'm not gonna let you do that while you have an individual attached to you Because she's dragging you down, you'd have to make a contested strength save. And if you fail, you both fall. Okay, um... Because you're willingly lowering your max speed to raise hers already. No, that makes sense. Give me a sec. I'm looking over my stuff again. Okay, Genesis, what would you like to do? Um... So I've got the fire crystal in my sword. I'm gonna... Walk up to the door and just kind of... Stand there, terrified of bugs. Okay, you don't see any bugs inside of the building. No bugs. I've got something to help Genesis if you don't mind. Yeah, absolutely. What would you like to do? Uh, leading towards Genesis, I'm going to lay my hand on her shoulder while casting calm emotions and go, don't worry. They only have as much power as you give them. 15, 20, 25. And that's calm emotions. Okay, you successfully calm in motions, but Genesis also takes a thousand light damage Go ahead No, no, it's fine action has happened No, go ahead on okay, you could That was gonna damage Genesis By the way, Genesis, if you inch a turn within this aura, you will take further damage. Okay, I'm gonna move out of the aura. Alright. Damage him. Sorry. I'm trying to be different. Genesis, you feel your emotions calmed, but you know that you've been manipulated. I believe a caveat of the calm emotions spell is that you have to hate the person when it runs off, I think. I think. I'll let you all role play it accordingly. I've got the spell pulled up if you want me to read it. It's all good. trust that you all just roleplay, I'm not going to tell you all what to do in this situation. Oh, right here in the spell it says you can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. All right, Anake, what are you doing? I'm not, I'm not good. I'm gonna go where there were other people. Okay, which way? Left or right? I thought there was people in the dining room. There's the overseer right now and yourself and Genesis just walked in. I There are people down in the lower level that look to be like a living room. Oh Okay, I'll make my way there. Okay. Okay, so you get about you get about there Is there is there any interesting things that I could it looks like a the tables massive. It's almost as tall as you are I'll just grab that and put it in my pocket. No, you won't. I'm kidding. Alright. We're going to go ahead and say next turn. The simulation overseer is going to go over here and start talking to this individual. Something's happening with a persona. They're having a look around. Alright. Uh, Genesis, it's your turn. What would you like to do? I'm going to walk into the manor. Okay, you, uh, walk into the manor with your flaming blade. It is. Alright, anything else? Um... What the hell was that? What is what? No, sorry, random sound in my house. You okay, Mom? Okay. That was weird. Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and just end your turn. Oh, Nake, what would you like to do? Yeah, yeah, okay. Um, I'll continue into that room. Okay, you successfully get into the room. get into the room you see a couple people one person is sitting there like stitching and she looks up and she like she acknowledges your presence and then the other person is sitting there reading a book. What book is that? I'm getting you don't have to. You breathed upon yourself. Uh, it's uh, it says, Red, White, and Royal Blue by Casey McQuest- uh, question. Um, the- I read the book and it's in the movie. The book is pink with a red strip across the front. The back of the book has some kind of text you can't read, it's too small. Oh, that's funny. I don't know if anyone else gets it, but I do and it's hilarious! Alright, hopefully nobody looks at it by Google search history. Alright, so, um, all of you, Perception checks with advantage. That is hilarious, I rolled the exact same thing twice. Alright, what did you all roll? 17. Okay, acknowledged. Genesis? It's loading. Oh, not okay? 18. Alright. Advantage. 14. 17. Forgot my modifier. You all hear the buzzing sound getting louder give me just one second, please On your turn absolutely just give me just one second my friend, okay Okay, I'm gonna add some extra ambiance to this To this Encounter adventure to this encounter Give me just one second here. What is an each encounter and adventure of its own? Easily. All right, let's see here. Okay, cool. And we just need to resolution lock this and now if I capture the window I should be able to give you audio. Alright, hey. Alright, let's see. There you all are. Top of the round. Genesis, what would you like to do? I have to feel, I'm not getting any of your music audio. Right click on my share screen or it's client side, so you'll have to turn up the audio. There we go. I can't do it at all either. Yeah, you'll have, it's on your side, it's the setting you have to change on your side, I can't do anything. You can adjust the stream volume. Genesis. I can do it, I got it. It is now your turn. What would you like to do? Well, there's anybody. Not yet! I can't hear you anymore. Yeah, that's the problem with it. That's okay. You can mute it. For those that can listen, can listen. I like it though. Alright, what would you like to do? It's your turn. Hello? Hi, I can hear you. What would you like to do? Okay. Going to walk into where, where... Up into the right, where is that? It's like a little table there. Uh, this room? Main area. No, up into the right. So like over here? 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. I believe you have 30 feet of movement, yes? I believe I do as well. Okay, anything you want to do, any action or bonus action? Um, you know, as long as I'm inside, can I dash and upgrade that move into 60? Sure! Where are you headed? Same direction. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Uh, so you get about here. Okay. The scale of this map is starting to become apparent to you. It's now Anake's turn. What would Anake like to do? It's a manor, isn't it? Like a mansion. It's a one-story building. The table is abnormally tall, so is all of the chairs and everything in this house. The people are extremely tall. But they look like normal humans. But they look perfectly normal. What about the chairs? The chairs look extremely big. They are taller than you are. Okay, can I go see where the bug sounds are coming from? Absolutely. So you go five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. You get about there. Would you like to consume your movement? Yeah. Okay. Uh, your action to dash, I mean, five, ten, fifteen. You get here and you see a massive legion of bugs outside, all swarming. I am on the straight line, can I see it? Uh, let's see. No, you don't have- uh, well, you can see these two over here. Alright, that ends your turn, Anake. Genesis, you have no idea about any bugs, you just hear combat music. Or not, Genesis. Genova, what would you like to do? Being at Lady Light, I asked if you wish to investigate, or do you want to go around and explore the rest of the premises? I think we should investigate, but you should probably disengage the aura so that allies can be near me so I can heal them. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna pull out a white crystal and offer it before Lady Light to take. She declines. She asks that you prepare for anything that might be happening, and she doesn't want to accidentally drain you of your energy. Well, I've already got two crystal stacks, so supposedly she'd be draining those two crystals and the one in my palm. She declines as of right now, because she thinks that you might take critical damage if she does. I can say that you can consume an action to imbue your blade with every single stack of light that you have done to add a multiplier to your blade for one attack. Does that one attack wait last only one turn or does it actually... It lasts infinite turns until you actually use it. Okay, um... So your next attack will do 25 times more damage. Give me my favorite. How does this work? If you're gonna be teleporting around? Yeah, Ladylight doesn't teleport with you, if you teleport. Also, how do you teleport into someone? Do they get fragged? Alright. What are you doing, Genoba? I'm going away. I have a question. On your turn, please. No, yeah, never mind. I answered my own question. Never mind. I answered my own question. For now, I'm going to keep the aura going and just bring Lady Light as close as I can towards the others. Okay, as you try to move while you still have the aura, Lady Light's going to go, please, I would rather people be able to get close. That's why I want to get you as close as I can. I can go on ahead and do my own thing. Okay. But I don't want to leave you by yourself. Alright, you go 5, 10, 15, 20, and that's your max movement. Yeah. Because we are so far from the others, I don't have to worry about them getting damaged until they get close. And when they get close, I can just let leave Lady Light with them while I go off and do my teleporting stick. Okay, it's Lady Light's turn. She's going to reciprocate this and move you, 5, 10, 15, 20. Now Lady Fire and Ice's turn. She clearly sees the bugs and she is going to cast corpse to corpse as that is going to force her to get in melee range. She is then going to dual cast Jolt into Ver Thunder so she gains some black mana and then she is going to do just placement and she is going to go 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 540, 40 feet back, and then she is gonna move 15 feet away. 5, 10, 15. How much damage does that do? Okay, yeah, that bug's fine. All right, it's now the bug's turn. They are all gonna start swarming the guards. So... And some of them are going to start chasing after Fire and Ice. Alright, this one has slightly more movement speed, this one has less. Alright. Alright, that ends the bugs. Well, some of the other bugs are gonna move. Um, Kobayashi, would you like to do anything on your turn? As the bug leader? Alright. Uh, without revealing where you are on the map, etc, what would you like to do? Honestly, am I allowed to move my troops forward? They've already moved forward. They are swarming the enemy and they are about to duplicate. I just surround the place still. Okay, you instruct your army to surround the place and they acknowledge with every single bug starts like echoing like double team for Pokemon. Wait, wait, so one of the players is actually controlling the enemies. Oh, this is cool. And because there's so many, you can look at it from my tactical general standpoint. Oh, this is nice. I like this. All right. It is now the simulation overseer's turn. She is going to go 5, 10, 15, 20, break through the window, 30, she's going to use her dash action so 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. She's automatically going to get moved an extra 5 feet because of an obstacle. And she is then going to cast as her bonus action. They're too far away. Uh, Holy Spirit. She's gonna cast that as a free action using Oath. And that explodes this bug. It does 100,000 damage to everything around it. And this guard is outright killed. No! Alright. And then this bug is extremely weakened. Alright, and that ends her turn. Genesis, it's now your turn. What would you like to do? You just saw a bug explode. It's my turn. Turn you said? Sorry. is his turn. What would Genesis like to do? Um, I'm going to advance towards gray. Okay, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Alright, you're next to gray. You see all the bugs attacking the guards now They all look double-teamed Yes, roll a constitution saving throw with supreme disadvantage Yeah, my calm emotions has worn off you're kind of on your own buddy Also, there's a major hint in the icon that I used for the thugs. In case you want me to blow up the icons, you can see it easier. This is the bug that you are currently fighting. a six, okay, let's let something out of the heart starship troopers. Um, okay, uh, you, you freak out a little bit internally, but your protector, your paladin nature comes into play and your resolve as a hunter comes into play a hunter phantom. I'm sorry, can you repeat that? Oh, I just shouted for Siegfried. Okay. Um, anything else for your turn? You still have an action and a bonus action. Yeah, I was going to, um, before I rolled by Constitution. Go ahead. Zero. I'm looking at 19 seconds. Um, I guess, breath weapons. Uh, there's nothing within 15 feet of you. Darn it. Fire. Oh, not okay. You don't have any movement to spend on that. That's fair. It's still standing on me. You don't really have any ranged options. Yeah, I'm the paladin, so... Fine, I guess I will just... You want to hold your... Do you want to hold your action for if something approaches you? Yes. Alright cool that ends your turn didn't know that was a thing I will do that alright Anake it is now your turn What would you like to do? I'd like to remain at a distance So can I use oh wait? Do I start with full tanky? Yes, I believe that's what kanky says you do Do Yeah, you have a very complicated character sheet. And hurt the bugs with your glare. I recommend doing Jolt and then Glare. But you currently have 3 KK, so you could do an Aphelitus Misery for 300 or 200,000 damage. Uh, can I use... Oh no, I don't want to do that. For what? Looks like it does 1,050 damage, or 150,000 damage, sorry. Yeah, but also Fletch might do more. You could do Fletch and a Flizzus Misery. Okay, I'll do that then. Okay, so you do your Flizzus Misery, so it deals damage before it consumes the Kankai, so where would you like to aim that? a 15 foot radius circle. Oh, I would like you to know that I'll be here. No, you won't. Oh, where would you like to center the circle? It's this big. Uh, ideally on none of the guards and only bugs. One of those. A melee. Oops. Okay. Uh, how about right here? That's good. Okay. Greg it. Great. I have an idea if you're willing to listen. Yeah? Leave that one lone bug in the back alone, because if I'm reading my sheet right, I can use Quick Cut to teleport to that one. I can start weeding out their lines from the rear. You gotta use an attack first in order to activate Quick Cut though. Okay, then... Metterling, which allows me to teleport to a foe and deal total full DPS. If it's not shifted. If you use Quick Cut, it gets shifted. So, just as a word. You can always teleport to the... You can always teleport to the bugs, to the left of the... You know, the one next to the dead body. Okay, where are you aiming this? Is this satisfactory? Yeah, that seems good. Okay, I get to do some explosions. So, you all see as Genesis points her katana as radiant energy goes and a giant lily appears in the middle of a big group of bugs. As it does, it explodes. You use all your kankai, by the way. Remove them. Um, as you do, this bug explodes, this bug explodes, this bug explodes, this bug explodes, this bug explodes, this bug explodes, this bug explodes, and this bug explodes. The explosion takes out this bug, kills this guy out right, no, kills this guy out right, this bug and it explodes killing this person outright kills this bug kills this bug I felt that for a good bit alright I was wondering if you were going to kill a grand mom and you're casting Fletch you can't see any enemies I can't see oh yeah you're right I can't see any Can I move at all? Yeah you can move forward. Alright would you like to cast your Fletch now? Yeah sure, it's a bonus action. Okay cool. Uh, yeah, which one would you like to hit? Uh, the ones in the group to the right. Alright, what element? Uh, lights and so weak to light. You don't know that. I heard that they were weak to light, I thought. Okay, you know sure you pick light and I can this one explodes I'm meant to say I said the ones to the right. Oh sure This one explodes This one explodes This one explodes This one explodes This one explodes This one explodes This one explodes! This one explodes! This one explodes! And this one explodes! Oh my god! Okay, I was not expecting you to kill those. Alright, that's gonna end your turn because you're out of actions. Genova, it's now your turn! I can't see shit from where I am anymore, can I? Mark. My bad. Excuse you. It's okay. It happens. You can attempt to get to the doorway if you want. I was thinking because of where my angle is, I'd see those bugs that were in that group to the right and I'd be able to use a smetterling to teleport to them. Welcome to D&D turn-based combat. Lady Light looks at you and goes, go. Go after them. them as she lets go of you. There's nothing there though, I don't see it. They ran to the right, they're chasing something. Go! Run! You have your full movement, your movement has been restored. Okay, um, I have 30, can, right quick, can you pull out a ruler and show me how far 30 feet would go? Ron Typer Roller. Okay, and then I could probably use Kinetic Jawn to give me 40. And then from there, would I be able to see the bug to the far right or? You'd have to go outside, but you could easily get to it. But that would use my full turn, wouldn't it? Yeah, but here's the thing, being right where this right here is going to be a good position for you. Because there is a lot more enemies on the screen. Wait, give me a sec, I'm reading some things. Uh, is it kinetic jot in action? It is. Okay. But, if I don't use kinetic jot, I can still move a full 60 feet. Let me double check the spell first. spell first. Oh it is a bonus action! Oh that's not the music I wanted. It's a bonus action okay I could use the bonus action and then use a full sprint which would give me 80 feet of movement and then if I'm reading this right I could uh I could probably use my weapon action to shift my skills but I could then use smetterling to slide another 15 feet towards an enemy. Okay you want to actually do that? Or, actually, instead, I'll use Rose Schwart that, when shifted, allows me to jump 15 feet in the air, toward, um, then make a slash in the air that stays for two times. Okay, what are you doing? What's your battle plan? One action and a time, one thing at a time for me. Bonus action, kinetic jaunt, increase my movement from 30 to 40. Alright, success. Spring 80 feet forward towards the door All right Five ten fifteen twenty twenty five thirty thirty five forty five ten fifteen twenty twenty five Thirty thirty five all right. Nope. Just straight out. Okay straight out Now Then for a free action, I'm gonna use my weapon action to shift my skills All right, uh, let's see Okay, your next action is Shifted Then I'm gonna use a Vulcan pretzer, okay Okay. Main action or bonus action, jump into the air 15 feet and stab the ground with your weapon. Do you have a main action or a bonus action you can spend at this time? No, I don't think so anymore. Okay. Am I in a good spot? Okay, and your next action is shifted. Yeah. So, keep track of that. It's now Lady Light's turn. She is going to... Go ahead. Alright, Genesis, you hear this. Alright, it's now Lady Light's turn. She is going to dash. dash. Uh, 5, 10, 15, 20, 5, 10, 15, 20. Both Genesis and Onake are now at full health. She is going to prepare a spell, an undisclosed spell, and that is going to end her turn. It is now Lady Fire and Ice's turn. She is going to corpse to corpse to the side of the enemy. She is going to do... Oh I don't have this pulled up one moment. Let me... What is corpse to corpse exactly? Like... look like? She pulls out her rape ear. One second, I'm so sorry. I have to pull up the red mage information here. Cause she's a red mage. She is gonna cast her ultimate ability. And this is Enhanced Repose. It does... All right. She completes that. She does Enhanced Z. and then she does enhanced redoublemint. She then does displacement and jumps back here. This gives her an ability. She's gonna cast Verholy now. Let's see, where's Verholy? Yep, she casts Verholy. This one explodes. She's then going to turn around to the other one and cast Scrunch. As this one explodes, and then she is going to consume her movement to go 5, 10, 15. And she is going to prepare a spell for her main action. And that ends her turn. Alright, give me just one second, y'all. That's what I'm reading isn't it? I have to move the new enemies on the field because you successfully killed all of the other ones. Um, Julian. He didn't do anything. It was Grey's bad. Do what? I almost swore to him. We didn't do anything. It was Grey's awesomeness that did all the work. Oh right. Julian, you running out there was just like, what are you doing Mickey? Do you even know what Birch and In? Oh, right. So these purple ones are not actually on the arena yet. I do apologize. I brought them out because the mechanic needs them out. But you all see as some of these orange ones start flying in. These ones are really scary if you know what they do. Oh, wait. The orange one. These are the orange ones! Alright! Um... Dearest, uh, Kobayashi, what would you... Do you have any instructions for your minions? Hmm... Sorry... Uh, what can I do? Sorry. You have three things. You can issue a command, you can start charging your ultimate attack, which takes four turns, Or you can do a double slash attack if you're within melee of a character Sorry give me a minute if you issue a command every single bug under your under your command gets double actions Okay Sorry, I issue a command. Okay, what command? You can clearly see the battlefield. You have like a like an overview of the battlefield. Yes. Yes, I March forward and okay as you say that all of the uh, oh Goodness gracious All right, as you say that all of the bugs under your control react and start to swarm the arena uh Uh... So! You all see... As a bunch of big bugs show up. Uh, and then behind that, there is this massive... Blue bug. That seems to be a leader of sorts. floating up in the sky, it is massive. Looks to be like miles on miles long. They are all going to swarm Genova. If they can swarm Genova, they are. Else they're going to move forward. They've all consumed all of their movement. Anything else you would like tazor off. I'm pretty sure the blue bug can charge up his ultimate, correct? He will do that on his next turn. He's consumed all of his movement to get into the arena. Is there anything I can do since I've tried... You've consumed your action, but you can designate what you would like to do for your next turn if you'd like. my next turn I would like to charge up my ultimate. Okay, you will start charging your ultimate. Um, all right, cool. That ends your turn. It's now the simulation overseer's turn. I'm happy to zoom the map in. All right, um, the simulation overseer's gonna consume her movement. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Can she reach you? She can. Okay! So, Jenova, you feel a tether go from you to an entity behind you. What does that mean? You feel protected. Got it. Alright, she consumes a nose to do that. Alright. As the simulation over- is that an action? Oh, it's a free action. Okay. She's gonna consume her action to cast... Oh, she can't do that because she doesn't have movement. Uh... yeah, she ends her turn. Genesis, it's now your turn. What would you like to do? I couldn't hear you. I'm sorry. What? Outside. Go outside. Okay, you're gonna go outside. Uh, 5, 10, 15, 20. Alright, you're outside. What are you doing? Um, I'm just gonna... You know what screw it, I'm going to... Oh, what's it called, dash. And then go for the... You have 10 feet of standard movement, you can do. Oh, well let's use all the movement. Okay, you can hear You see no no there's there is somebody within ten feet yes Could I oh wait wait Could I go um towards the simulation over here and consume an action to dash sure five Ten fifteen you are now next to the simulation overseer. I believe I can then use a bonus action attack Uh, you have to move up five more feet, are you okay with that? Sure. Okay, which one are you attacking, left or right? Um, where am I on? Left. Okay. What are you casting? I would use fire. You know what, is breath weapon viable? Up to you. I'd... Up to you. What do you mean up to me? Like, is it viable within your rules? You can use it right now if you'd like. I'd like to use it then. Go to your lord. You went really quick before I use it. Uh, yeah? Um, let me see, can I do this? You're realizing how much damage you do. I'm... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, give me a second. Give me a second. Where is it? What are you looking for? There's Holy Spirit. Oh, it's Action Ammoving Action. That's okay. I'm just going to use the breath weapon then. Okay. This one dies. Unless you want to point it at Genova. I was going to see if I could pop DPS. I'm just going to use the breath weapon then. Okay. This one dies. Unless you want to point it at Genova. I was going to see if I could pop DPS. I was going to see if I could pop DPS. I was going to see if I could pop DPS. I was going to see if I could pop DPS. pop DPS. Absolutely. Just letting you know if you do that you will just flat out kill Jenova. Oh no! No you won't actually. You won't kill Jenova. Would you like to do that? Yes. Okay. This one explodes. Jenova you are now stunned. This one explodes. Jenova you are stunned again. This one explodes. Jenova, you are stunned again. This one explodes. Jenova, you are stunned again. You don't get a turn. Next turn, because you're stunned. This one explodes. Jenova, you are stunned. Both Genesis and Jenova are stunned. Jenova, you take a total of zero damage, the simulation overseer drops to one knee, and that tether continues, but you feel as though they are extremely weakened. Alright, sorry, I'm gonna try to get some new combat music up and running. You're fine, I'm just- How many turns does that skip? One. Okay, because it almost sounded like I had like six turns skipped from that one. No, it stacks. You have six stacks of one turn. They're all going to pop next turn. Okay. Yep. Uh, you're, Genesis, your turn is forcibly ended because you are stunned. Oh, not okay. What would you like to do? like to do? Run away, just kidding, no run away. Do it, run away! No, uh... Get coward! I'm not a coward, I'm gonna help my friends, they're the best of my ability. Yes, run away! I'm joking, sorry. You can say that! You're the bad guy, aren't you? Yeah, we were building here. Alright, what are you doing, Anake? Uh, I'm gonna go out there. Okay. Five, ten... Oh, they're fighting orange bugs! 15... 20... 25, 30... You get about here. Would you like to cast, uh, like, uh... Jolt Glare? Okay, you successfully cast Glare. This one explodes. And this one explodes. Wait, Glare cost? You gain a kanky. From Joel? No, from Glare. No, but Glare cost me. No, it doesn't. Oh no, you gain one. Oh, sorry. Also, uh, Reed Jolt, Glare becomes just a bonus action. Because you're also a red mage. Alright, uh, that consumes all your actions. It is now Lady Light's turn. She is gonna go 5, 10, 15, 20. She is going to cast Mass Rescue. She's going to keep you at distance actually. She's not going to rescue you. As everybody within her circle is now going to be healed and topped off on their HP so So everybody tops off. Alright and she is then going to cast something. Yep, she casts something. And that ends her turn. Lady Fire and Ice is going to cast Jolt Ver Arrow on this enemy and this enemy they both explode. And she is going to step behind Genesis as it is now Tatharoth's turn. So very first thing that happens is all of your units duplicate. Including the big ones, except for me of course. Any one that can duplicate duplicates. Okay, cool. So give me a second to resolve this. Alright. You are unable to issue a command because you are currently charging an ultimate attack. Cool. Alright. Uh, this one is also going to spawn more of these purple bugs. Okay. So until my final is done charging, there isn't much I can do. You can't- well, you can stop charging to issue a command if you desire Tazroth. No, I'd rather keep charging. Okay, you're one out of four turns. Oh, she, can I just say you've got the perfect voice for a villain? Like, drop down a couple of octaves and you are perfect. Alright, so the bugs are now going to start their turn. So first thing that's gonna happen is Jenova is going to get swarmed. Yes! What? And they're also going to come down here and attempt to get to the rest of the party. This is my last command I issued, correct? Yes. Cool. Alright, these boogers are gonna fly over here and all four of them are going to start a charge attack against Jenova. And all of these boogers are going to attempt to move forward. Wait. Alright. And I'm going to take just a one minute... I have to run to the restroom. So one minute, like five minute break? Feel free to discuss amongst yourselves. While I'm away, be right back. Leave me alone! Do not touch me, leave me alone! I've got a plan, I need you to leave me alone for work! Okay, I'm... So, you want to stay away from me? Quickly, go up and touch him. No, literally I'm probably just gonna go faint and cast Lucid Dreaming. My last issued command is to charge forward and to surrounding and then I started charging at my old community, so. Ah, yeah, this is gonna be fun. Sorry. I reiterate, Bochi. Perfect voice for a villain. I seriously dude you'd make a perfect James Bond film. The Catboy from VRChat's the perfect James Bond film of course. Do you see my profile picture? Yes. Do you get what it is? No. Final Fantasy VII, a mercenary character by the name of Cloud Strife. It wields a giant sword called a Buster Squad. At one point he has to cross-dress to save a friend. That is what my profile picture is of, is him in the cross-dress outfit. Nice. But uh, yeah, no. It's nice to meet you all of you. I'm thinking about like, I'm actually going to uh, like, join in the future, have like my character creation. It's very, very high chance. So yeah. Honestly, I say go for it. The problem is you really enjoy it. Also, your voice is just... oh my god, I can fall asleep to it. Yeah, I'm usually behind a screen and I have a pretty expensive microphone. Alright, I have returned. Welcome back! Jenova. You are going to get attacked. 8 times. You are getting attacked 8 times. Each one deals 30 damage. You're stunned. Each one does 30 damage to you. Okay. But you take zero damage in total. You see as the simulation overseer gets weaker and weaker and weaker as they take 700 points of damage. Oh no. Alright, the bugs are then going to... these four are charging an attack against you. This one's preparing a raid wide, so raid-wide's effect everybody on the... in the world. And so now, it's a simulation overseer. They're HP, they heal for 15,000, so they are back to full health. Because they are going to pass through Ladylight Square, and they are going to cast Passage of Arms. Anybody behind them is now protected. And that's all they can do because that consumes everything that they can do. It is now Nebula's turn. Nebula, you are stunned. Uh, Genesis, sorry. Genesis, you are stunned, so it is now a knock-a-sturn. Um. Alright, I have a couple questions. First off, what does Quirk the Quirk look like in, like, combat? So this is for Arrow, Hardcast. This is first stone, hard cast, into a... uh... Fletch Vrfire That is a corpse to corpse. You just saw it go off, it brought it to the... enemy And they're doing their ultimate combo. Here's the Vrholy going off now. Here's the Scratch going off now. And here's the Vrfire into Vr Thunder. Into a Fletch. Okay, thanks. It literally just looks like you're getting pulled by the sword. Second question, what is there? Since this is a real time game, how does like, turn based combat work? Every turn is 6 seconds, let's go. What would you like to do? Oh, um, I'm sorry. I was just like, I was like, never mind. You're good. I'm joking with you. It's six seconds because D&D logic. Um, okay. Uh, that's pretty much all I had to say. Okay. Can I see if I can cast Lucid Dreaming? Also, what does that do exactly? It consumes all of your movement to gain one black and white mana. Okay, and that's it? Yep. Okay, can I do that? Alright, you fall asleep. You fall asleep in the middle of combat. Yep, you fall asleep. I don't know where the- You just peed me on this side, chuckling. I'm sorry. Uh, you mean up in the sky? Up in the sky, chuckling, sorry. Uh, alright. Nap time for you. Uh, you're down for the next three turns. Are you sure you want to do this? I mean, doesn't it, like, put you in another, like, place or something? No? No? No? I thought, I thought, last time I ca- last time, last time somebody casted, they ended up going into that other dimension thingamajiggy. Was this individual a persona? Yeah. Huh, weird. Oh, so that doesn't work. Okay, I, I never mind. I'll let, I'll let you have a mole again on this one. one. I'll let you mulligan this. Alright, what would you like to do? Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't completely understand what I did. It's all good. Okay, um... You see four bosses and a bunch of enemies targeting Genova. I'd like to retract my previous statement about not needing help. Sorry I was laughing in the background. Alright, Onake, what are you doing? Reaction bonus action Okay, um Could I do fudge jolt and then glare is that A possibility This but but says it can be passed as a free action. Absolutely. Which one are you targeting? the big ones that are charging up okay what element light okay they look like they take reduced light damage from this go ahead and tell me your um your uh how much damage you deal non crit what on crit non crit okay 23,000 i said non crit non crit oh sorry i said i thought i said on on on on okay how much How much damage did you do? Uh, uh, uh, 12, 12,000, 130. Okay. Alright. Uh, and you, uh, okay. You, uh, you do that. Alright. Um, you cast Jolt. Mm-hmm. All right, that does 3,060. No, that's on crit. Yeah, I will say it crits. All right, and then you're casting glare. Yeah. All right, and that does what appears to be a thousand-ish. And then I gain 110 crit. Yes, you gain a Kankai. Okay. Oh, it's not working how I want it to. Okay, backup plan. Give me one second here. I'm gonna track the damage on my old HP tracker sheet. Alright. Okay, I've tracked it. Alright. This one explodes. Uh...it applies...it hits everything on the arena. It applies a 10% vulnerability up to everything on the arena, including Tatharoth. Uh, and that ends your turn. Not that bad. Genova, you are still shifted. It is now your turn. I can move again? Yes, but also I have bad news. Oh. Uh-huh. You remember that light ore you have around you? Yeah. This one explodes. This one explodes. This one explodes. This one explodes. This one explodes. This one explodes. This one explodes. This one explodes. This one explodes. The simulation overseer starts to severely bleed. They take 8,925 damage. Did they not heal while inside? They do, at the start of their turn. But it's your turn. What would you like to do? Okay, let me double check to make sure my plan will still work. So, right quick, charging a crystal is a bonus action, correct? No, it is an action. It is a full action, okay. Okay. Um. Okay. I'm not allowed to draw on my own map. Okay. Oh, okay. Cool. What kind of action would it be if I were to drain the aura into my sword? action. It would be a full action. Okay. I'd like to use a roast sword. Okay. And it's shifted to fate? It's shifted. So you jump a 15 feet and you do a slash in the air. No, that's right or am I reading the wrong one? Nope, you're right. Alright, a slash appears. Any enemy that enters that will take massive damage. I then like to use Quick Cut to warp towards... Is that...? So that's how you activate Quick Cut. Yeah. Okay so you are casting as a bonus action. So which enemy are you warping to? Big blue. Okay. You warp to it and you deal 25,000ish damage. You're currently in lined with light so you only deal about 10,000 damage. Okay. You still have a bonus action. I do. And your next action is in fact shifted. Also, you're floating up in the air right now. Okay. I'm reading my things. Give me a sec. Yep. Um, could I actually work my air, my floating air thing into a Vulcan Kratzer? I mean you're already, so you'd go 15 feet higher and then you would fly 30 feet into the ground and do a shockwave on the ground. But that would work, yes? That wouldn't hit the enemy at all because it'd be slamming into the ground and causing a 15 foot circle, but that's up to you. I thought I could do it on top of the big blue enemy. You would be forced to go to the ground. It forces you to go to the ground through anything. It means you are now on the ground and there is a 15 foot shockwave on the ground. Alright. other one goes away and you have a slash through the big blue. It takes about what appears to be 20,000 damage-ish, but is actually 10. Alrighty, and it will take that every turn it sits there. That ends your turn because you are out of actions and movements. These go back to their non-shifted state, correct? Did you use weapon action last? No. Okay, then they're not shifted. Okay. All right. It is now Lady Light's turn. She's gonna look around. And she is going to cast Dia on Tazaroff. She gains a Lily. She consumes her bonus action and her movement to start charging a spell. Alright, that ends her turn. It is now Ladyfire and Isis turn. She is going to corpse to corpse. Right up next to Genova. Oh, we'll do right here instead. And she is going to cast her ultimate. So she does her 3 slash. Alright, that does some damage. She does the Z. That does some damage. She does the final stab, does some damage. Instead of displacement, she does, she stays put, she casts Verholy gaining to White Manna, and then she casts Scronch gaining to both manas. And then she will, for her action, will cast, or for her free action will cast Fletch with Darkness Element. And that ends her turn. It's now Tatharoth's turn. Um... So first off, all the bugs have to duplicate. So give me just a second here to resolve that. Alright the bosses, you are two turns in your ultimate. I am still resolving the duplication one moment please. Uh, okay. Alright, Tatharoth, would you like to cancel your charging to issue a command or continue charging? Okay, how much health left do I have of the blue beast? It looks healthy. looks healthy so it's not being as damaged by the purple thing. It seems as though it's light element so it seems to be resistant to that particular element type. Okay. Per chance, how much damage is it doing and how much health is it doing? I can't tell you that. It looks healthy. It looks healthy. I keep on charging. Okay, you are two out of four turns. Uh, the bugs are now going to start swarming the simulation overseer. Oops. I squished the bug. One mini bug. One very mini bug. Alright, so now I need to resolve these three bosses attacking Jenova all at once. All of them do over a million damage to Jenova. Jenova, you take zero. The simulation overseer goes- Wait, I was gonna see if I could use a reaction. Go for it. What would you like to do? Umm, let me double check this spell. Can I use Hellish Rebuke? Go for it. What does that do normally? Point my finger at the creature that supposedly damages me. Is momentarily surrounded by Hellish flames? Okay, we're gonna say light flames. It critically fails because I'm just gonna say it critically fails because you're a Uh, it- what do you tell it to make its brain explode? Well, no, Hellish Rebuke is an infernal legacy spell. It's- it's currently light-aligned. So what do you do to make it, uh... To make it radi- like what do you do to make its head explode? Bik, what do you say? Do you just grud at it? No, that's not how Hellish Rebuke works. It's a blast of actual fire. Okay, it's not a bunch of light flames surrounded and they form swords and go into it. This one explodes. Everything on the arena gains a further 10% vulnerability. It's a 60-foot radius around the target. Oh, crud. You're kidding, right? Nope. Okay. All right. All right. Behold the power of a princess of flame. All right. A nuke just hit the map. Don't have any 10 fire damage though. No, it, it, I'm saying it does like 100 times your weapon action damage. Man, I don't know much about sword shooting, but that man will cast an upright down, down, down. I know, right? Uh, give me a moment to resolve all of this, please. Oh my god, okay. This one dies. This one dies. This one dies. You want to die? These all die. These all die. These survive. Oh my god. At the page everything in the affected area must make a deck saving throw. All of the bugs critically fail. Sorry, I can't discuss while we're... while I'm deleting things. I was making that note for the players in the affected area. The players critically succeed because they are protected. Lady Fire and Ice needs to make the role though. She's the only one that's not protected right now. She succeeds. Everything has a 150. 150. No. No. No, because they're up in the sky. They're not on the arena yet. Are they above 60 feet in the sky? They are literally as big as the sun. Oh. Yeah, they're in space right now. Yeah, they're charging some kind of attack. They look very scary. Also, the simulation overseer is now very unconscious. As six bugs just exploded in her face. The tether that they had with you is gone. All right, uh Okay, the big bug is going to attempt to do a raid wide everybody takes 200 points of damage So for characters that drop to zero let me know if you drop to zero um Yeah, I dropped a negative 20 No, you dropped a zero. You can't go negative. Oh my god, is that everybody on the field? That is everybody except for Genesis goes unconscious. Nice. Okay. So every single person is unconscious. Except for Genesis. Except for Genesis. So both fire fire and ice and jenova fall out of the sky Whoo? And hit the ground Wow, okay, so it's just gonna be Genesis turn and then You hear Tazaroff you hear a voice in the back of your head It sounds familiar. It sounds peaceful even It is the voice of margarita a familiar individual who speaks to you often and she says please stand down my soldier. Would you like to comply or would you like to keep charging? I comply because I can't not do that. Okay. Uh, for now, your bug friend's gonna go right here while I fix a couple of mechanics here. So I have to knock everybody out. Worth it. I'm sorry. Absolutely worth it. I like how everyone knows it's just unconscious and all I hear is worth it. That's Julian for ya. Alright. The bug flutters away. I moved your battlefield. Who would it be proud? Alright, we are no longer in turn order. Everybody who is unconscious eventually wakes up to see Margarita. Just Margarita, no bugs, no tether off, just Margarita standing there. She's kind of half dressed in her normal outfit. She has the pink and white hair just like Luther and she just kind of, she's like leaning against a tree. Did anyone else see that? See what? The proverbial death that I unleashed. You unleashed a nuke, which was funny. That's what I said, you just went full up right down, down, down. 500 kilograms, come and act ya! Indeed. I want you all to roll a perception check. Atro 20. Okay. Roll him. No, it's crazier. That was a first level spell. That was what? A first level spell. 21. Okay. I liked how Midnight was just like, oh yeah, like, I'm just gonna use a first level spell. I could have used worse, but let me knock out my entire crew. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Ray, you here? Ray! Yeah, sorry. Hi. Perception check! Oh, yeah, six. A six? I didn't know that. I was muted and I didn't know that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, May I ask why you returned? Wait, what are we standing on right now? Uh, you're like sitting on the stairs of the building. Okay, a few. I thought it was bugs. Or, well... You all don't see any bugs, actually. It seems as though she understands Genesis' fears and made all the bugs go away. Try to cast Cure Wounds at 3rd level on the Overseer. Absolutely. Times that by 100. How much do you heal? How much do you heal? Me a sec. I like the addition of this music. Yeah, what music is it? This is just starrail music. Oh it is? Yeah, it's like... It's pinnaconi music. Oh, pinnaconi. He said multiply by a hundred? Yes, multiply by a hundred. You want to hold off on that. Please don't... Please don't medigame. Alright, fifteen hundred? Alright. Uh, you do that. She's healed. Um... Oh no. thing you notice though does not change. I can't understand you Genesis what you say? Hold on let me turn the screen volume down. Oh there we go now y'all can have the music Awesome. Um, is everyone else still knocked out? No, everybody's awake. How are we doing on HP for people? Ah, make a perception check. Well, Genesis is doing that. I'd like to cast a healing word on the overseer at second level. Okay, that succeeds. Um, you fully heal them. And you... they still look like they're like... I rolled a 13 on perception. You notice that Jenova's acting very strange. Well I can turn to her and just, Genova, you okay? Roll another perception check, Genesis. What'd you get, Genesis? Alright, you noticed that Jenova for some strange reason is awkwardly focused on the simulation overseers who seems to be severely bleeding from her face. Oh. Can I roll a medicine check? Absolutely. You have advantage because you've been working on resolving this. Also Luna may I ask? What's up? What's up? Well, I mean, what is happening to me while I'm gone? You are just floating around the universe with your bugs rebuilding. Okay, makes sense. 19. Okay. 19. Yep. Yeah, you succeed. Let's see. You realize that this person has been critically injured and that you should probably check in reality to actually see if their body is like severely injured or not. Because you feel like curing them in the in the simulation when they have an actual like injury in real life is not as effective. I'm gonna rip my headset off. Ah, I do not recommend ripping it off, but you can, you can try to take it off if you'd like. Please. Okay. You slowly relax and you open your eyes inside the headset. You click the button that releases it because you know which button does that. And it goes and comes off Only you see this by the way the others don't you see the simulation overseer with her headset on Slumped in her chair like bleeding like blood coming out of the headset Yeah rushing over I'm going to Hmm. What, have a way of contacting a medical? Yeah, you see the big red button next to the simulation overseer that says medical. I'm gonna hook that and then I'm gonna start performing triage, emergency triage on the overseer. Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and say you two are removed from the scene for now. We're gonna let the other players have a couple of turns in the simulation here real quick. Alright, so as y'all are sitting on the stairs you see all that go down and Margarita just looks at you and she goes, resilient people you are. Are you gonna be done meddling soon? What are we meddling with? I don't know. I don't know. It's my life. You all keep coming back and keep messing with us. On the contrary, I think you're messing with me. You're the one who showed up in my realm. Uninvited at that. Wait, so the simulation, you're... What do you mean by simulation? Wait, is this one of the simulations? This isn't real. It's not? Wait. Those dead bodies look very real to me. Wait. I'mma go pinch myself real quick. Okay, you feel like you've taken, like, you've been pinched. What if I try to take my headset off? You breathe in and breathe out, you try to get calm, but you can't take it off. What's going on right now? What? Did the kind simulation overseer, per se, tell you what is actually happening? No, not really. When you put on the headsets, as she says that all of your headsets get taken off by medical personnel. I'm gonna start like slapping at you know being angry you know I'm gonna try to force it back on nothing happens I'll be back in um do you all notice the simulation overseer like jenova pouring over the simulation overseer She is severely wounded, it looks like. As for the personas, you all look over and Lady Light is just sitting there like with her half smile and you just hear her like say, that was fun. her head just kind of rolls over and she closes her eye as the fire and ice. You notice that there is some melted floor under her. And a bunch of the medical people have what appear to be like ice blowers on her. What? What's the question? Yes? Am I still charged with the white crystals? No, you are not. You went unconscious. Okay, so the energy dissipates when I'm unconscious. Good to know. Yes, and also it does not travel across the simulation. But, okay, I'm confused about that because the last session when I charged fire crystals I melted the floor of the crystal. I reworked the crystals. I thought we agreed on that. It's okay if you don't agree on that. You didn't explain it to that extent. Yeah, I fully reworked them. That's because you did those fire crystals last time before the rework, so I had some fun with it. Okay. Sorry. No, it makes sense. All right. What would you all... Oh, fire... yeah, fire and ice. They have a bunch of like ice shooters and they're shooting ice at her. Like freezing air at her. What do you all do? I'd like to check in with the medical staff to see if everything's going to be okay with the overseer. They are currently working on getting her out and they don't know. all just kind of be like let us do our job and see if we can rescue her. Nine. This is a fitting song to come on. Oh my gosh. This is so fitting. This is when Firefly dies. Um. Yeah. Alright. Alright. Looking over at the others, I'm gonna just coily ask, so did I miss anything interesting? Genesis is filled with rage. The only one who looks happy about the situation is Lady Light. You want to know? Mm-hmm. I'm really sorry to cut the short. Y'all can keep going without me, but I have to go. Good night. Be safe. I'm doing okay. It's just... Bye, guys. Bye. Please be safe. Don't do anything stupid, Julian. Do everything stupid? Okay, I hope I hope she's okay Can you let me know if she's not okay I will Okay She tends to get tired around now though. This is usually when she calls it quits the medical staff at Scorts her to her room All right, looking over at lady light And everyone else, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna take my wife back to her room. The medical... The medical staff look at you. Questioning. Is there a problem? We would like to assess all of you. Gather some data, if you don't mind. We also need eyewitness reports to what happened. No, you're not taking me. How you like? Give me four hours for a shower, a hot meal, and to write in my journal. And then absolutely I will answer the questions you have for the best of your ability. I think you forget where you are. Let me rephrase, you're coming in for questioning. You basically, what appears to be, you basically assaulted a overseer, which is an extreme crime. That's what it looks like. They might be dead. They might be dead. As they gesture you all through the doors, please come willingly and it will only take about 10 minutes to interview you. If I answer your questions, you gotta hook me up with a therapist. I'm starting to have concerns about everything going on. They chuckle and they go, absolutely, we'll schedule you a therapist for next week. Actually, as you walk, as they walk through the doors, if you want to follow you can. It's up to you too. Did I get any of the overseer's blood on my hands? That's up to you. Assuming I was performing emergency medical triage. Well, attempting to. Attempting to. than most likely I would have, so. Yeah. Okay. It's red and it kind of sparkles. I'm gonna look back at where the overseer was seated. Ah, finally! Okay! I want you to roll a perception check with Supreme Vantage, please. Supreme? That's three? 4. So it's supreme is always 4. Okay. Gotta re-roll that one. Okay, this is confusing. I rolled a natural 20 and then a natural 1. Okay, take the highest number, so natural 20. Okay. So you see sitting in the chair a corrupted form of what looks to be like the simulation overseer, but her she looks different. She looks as though she has like like darkish green hair and like golden yellow eyes. But she's in like the same outfit and it's kind of like you can see through her like it's like a echo of the past. She's looking right at you. I'm going to walk forward and kneel down before whispering a simple question. What's your game and where do I fit? She looks at you dead square in the eyes. and she whispers right in your ear and she says... SPOILERS as she disappears AHH Also, I took my headphones off for that so I didn't hear anything, so... Immersion. She basically said... Don't, don't, don't tell her. Whoa. Don't tell her. This character books the crap out of me! Alright, that's Rip. Her. Alright, let's see. Oh, I'm looking at the wrong character. There we go. Did that echo leave anything of note behind? Anything... Ah, yes, there is a note on the chair. Can I read it? Yes, you can. It says Dear Genesis, Anoke, Jenova, Olivia, and Shiva. I appreciate your friendship. Thank you for an amazing couple of weeks. Signed Aspen. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait And then I would like to fold that up and see if I can store that in my pouch with magic crystals. Alright, you do that. The hospital overseer comes to door and asks, are you all ready? No. Please do hurry. There are anything else to see about the room. Anything of note, anything that raises suspicion. Other than all the headsets have gone back into the ceiling and the, uh, the stones have gone back into the wall? No, not really. Uh, the simulation overseer's headset is still like on the ground being cleaned by......uh, hospital staff. Uh, there's nothing of any interest to me. Well, Lady Light's still on the ground, she's kinda half-smiling. She looks like she's kind of... She's kind of just relaxing. Like, she's like resting. Lady Firenize is kind of just vibing. She's sitting up now while they're still spraying her with like freezing liquid nitrogen. I'm going to walk over to Wifey, pick her up, and then finally follow the person who wants the uh... report. You know it's better for me to build muscle if you let me walk. It would also be more... I stop and look at her. You're probably right! And I pull out a white crystal before offering it to her. Just this once. She goes and takes it. As she touches it, it disappears. Nothing noticeable seems to happen to her. What happened before? her her crutch I help her stand. She stands up just like she stands up like she's invigorated and she kind of hobbles dragging her dragging her left leg with her but she looks like she has like more strength now. just as a reminder you gave her three crystals before that happened And I... Yep. So one of them was because she drained your life force. So you gave her one crystal. I was offering her a single white. Yep. You're right, I offered her one white crystal earlier, and then I tried to offer her a second. you took 160 points of damage. Okay. Alright. What are you thinking? You all walk into the room that's linked to the simulation room right now? I'm thinking a lot of things. None of them are good and none of them I'm sure I can confess with my voice. You could DM me if you want. If you want to whisper something to a character. That's the thing. Jenova doesn't know what's safe to say to anyone. She doesn't know who to trust. why she has her journal. Interesting. Okay. Interesting way to say that you don't trust Lady Light. After everything that's happened, it's beginning to waver and flicker like a flame. That's interesting. Very interesting. As you all walk in, you see the head officer and the hospital overseer and the head of staff all in a room looking at you all. And they There they go. Was the damage inflicted to the simulation overseer intentional? This is all we need to know. Any of you all? I don't know if it was all too much damage to her, but I used a sacred magic that only Only those of my kind know, and I caused a lot of destruction and I don't know if anyone else was hit. They pull up a stone, comes out of the wall, like the ones in the simulation room, and you see a video playback of what the simulation overseer saw. is they see you taking massive damage and it getting transferred to her. And they go, ah, I see. So she protected you. Did they not see the hellish rebuke or? Well, she actually went like, the turns started at that point because that's when she took the multiple millions of damage. Because when those bugs all exploded around you and I said, oh, you take no damage. That's basically when her mind exploded. Got it. So they go, she protected you. You are dismissed and we will forget Um, and we apologize for any wrongdoing or blame. You are free to leave. I'm gonna look at them all and say, I would like to know if they survive. You are welcome to visit them. You are welcome to visit them in the medical wing. Oh, not gay. Your friend left a letter for you, by the way. And they hand you a letter. Uh-huh. I'll go ahead and read that. All right. It says, checking in with you, love. From your friend. Oh friend, yeah. And it has like a little smiley face at the end. Alright. What do you three do? You see a human individual come over and they kind of just hang out with you all. They look to be medical staff but you're not quite sure. Kobayashi, you can join as this NPC. As the NPC we were talking about before in the other chat? No. you're just a human NPC following them around now. So you can chat with them now. What would you three like to do? Who's the person who took my headset off? Some random medical staff person, you haven't seen them since. I'm going to go find food. Okay, you go over to the door and hit the thing and go to the tavern? Can I get their name? You didn't get their name, no, and you haven't seen them since. No, can I get their name? Uh, it'd be very difficult. Never mind. So I'm just a character in the background? You're a character in the foreground, so you're able to talk to the characters and NPCs. Hmm You are just a generic medical staff individual Feel free to give yourself a personality or anything you want Question here. Am I pushing great? Huh or you said like I'm a medical staff am I in the room or is yeah, you're in the room with the characters those like trolley things Okay, so You don't know what to say It's hard to come up with a character at the end of the spot. Alright, so do you three go to the tavern? Tavern? Oh, not gay? Genova? It's the territory. Oh, yeah, I'm already going. Okay, uh, you all see is uh, jenova walks through the door to the tavern As a medical staff representative, I have to come with you guys to make sure that you guys are okay and healthy That's my response. I think okay Uh, you follow okay looking back. I'm gonna Without looking back. I'm gonna flip the medical staff The bird and say bite me nurse, man Don't flirt. Don't flirt too hard, you two. Um, you all, uh... Hmm, actually, you know what? Hmm, okay. You all, uh... Anake, I'm assuming you follow. Greg Ray? Yeah, you follow? No, so you're just gonna stay in the medical area? Okay, what do you want to do in the medical area? I'm gonna go see what's going on. What people they're doing, you know, it's just that you're in an interrogation room. There's three people staring at you that are all overseers. Waiting for you to leave. Oh, okay. As you go out the door... I could just sit there. As you all go out the door though, I want you all to roll a perception check with advantage. Uh, six. Okay. Wait, if you roll a natural one in an advantage roll. It doesn't mean anything. Take the higher number. Okay. Yeah. Um, okay, I guess my dice like me because I got another natural 20. Oh god, okay. Oh, what did you get, uh, Kobashi? What do I do? Roll a d20, take the highest number. Roll it twice. Okay. Give me a minute. Okay. Okay, so roll a d20, got it. I'll roll a d20. Roll it twice. Okay, twice. I got 17 on the first, and on the second try, I got a 3. So you got a 17. So I got a 17 and a 3. All right, none of you all notice anything other than the other than the person that I just messaged. Oh, okay. Sorry, taking notes. Lady Light is like dragging her leg behind you all and she sits next to uh Uh... she sits next to you, Genesis, and... You mean Nova? Yes, Nova. Sorry, I was looking at Genesis' token. Hi, I'm Genesis. Hey yo! Ha ha ha ha ha! We'll bring Genova over here. Alright, here's you all three, you're in the bar. Actually, here, you know what? We'll just use this existing map. Here you go. So you all sit at the bar? What do you all uh... I wanna sit on the opposite side though. There is no opposite side. There's like a robot woman who's like... Oh! Not at an actual table at the bar, okay. Yep. Sorry about my loud key smashing. Okay, what are you four doing? Three players and one character? Okay, can I roll a perception check just to look around, I guess? Sure! Go ahead. I'm going to order a small meal and do what I'm sending you. Yeah, roll a performance check. Me? Yes. You have advantage. All right, what was that uh, perception check from the unnamed character? Well then, four. Uh, you just tell me the higher number. Uh, perception check? With advantage. Sorry. First... Okay, so with a d20? Yes, with advantage means roll the d20 twice take the higher number just tell me the higher number Okay, it's 12. Okay disadvantage means the same thing but take the lower number supreme means double it So roll four times Did I roll it four times? No You got a 12. No, you just have advantage You you see You see jenova writing something in the air with her finger as Does that conclude my turn or is this not turn based it's not turn based it's this section is not turn based I Walk over to Them and I see what they're writing You walk over I'm gonna say you can't really see what they're writing because they're not writing it like in an obvious manner They're like writing it kind of like in the air a little bit, but very like loosely Okay. Um, they could like someone drawing in the air with their finger. I mean, you could still understand what language did you write that in? It's true. I'm not sure you're right. This would probably understand any language I would write. So I'm gonna use infernal. Okay, no response. Okay. Taking a break to look over my my diary and eat my food. I'm gonna I'm gonna just quietly think to myself You feel a head land on your shoulder As you also feel a hand come to confirm that the head is on your shoulder Who is that? Is the medical practitioner allowed to just slightly like very slowly move his head right? Yeah, you see Lady Light like laying her head on Genova, but because you are aware that she can't feel the side of her face, she has to double check to make sure it's actually touching with her good hand. Okay. Because she has extreme Cotard's syndrome. Yeah, I understand, Katar. Um... Oh, Raki, what would you like to do? Probably go to bed. You're gonna head to bed? Yeah. Alright, your character gets up. Do you bow or anything? Sure, I'll go ahead and say goodnight. Okay. So you go downstairs and you go to your bed. It's comfy. Uh, do you tell the wall goodnight? I do. Okay. You have a dream when you do go to sleep. I will DM it to you later. Okay. Alright. Anyway. Thank you, Gray Gray, for coming. Hugs. I hope you liked it. Good night. If you didn't, please let me know what I did wrong. No, no, it was fun. Okay. I will read over your notes tonight, because I have them open. And from what I was glancing when you were writing them, it looks great. Yeah, it's slowly degraded over the course of the gameplay. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go back. It's okay because what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna send you all a copy of a Transcript of the recording of tonight from everybody's perspectives. Oh By the way, Luna. Did you see my message in Discord? Yes. Sorry. Yes, I did. Do you think that would be a good idea? I'm not going to... I'm gonna let... I'm gonna let Greg Ray finish their turn real quick. So Greg Ray, um, goodnight if you're going to bed. Yep. Love you friend. I am. And tell Mama, love her too. And can I call you all tomorrow? Uh, sure, yeah. Alright, get some sleep, okay? Um... Was I included in that request, or...? to call oh no I I meant I call her and her mama okay mama gray I want to check in on them like as a friend all right goodnight gray gray for now Kabashi let's not so we can actually get your character like established and I can in this character back to what they need to do, if that's okay with you. No, that's alright. Um, alright. Do I know it's Lady Light on my shoulder? I daresay you can see the beautiful purple hair with some light sparkles in it. I'm gonna lean over and kiss her while also doing something else that I'm missing Jing you. By the way, um, uh, Kavashi, you are the Lady Fire and Ice token. Oh, okay. But I'm still a medical practitioner. Yeah, you're just, you're just generic medical person that comes to the rescue. I like how funny that is. Just a medical practitioner just says something random like, I gotta go and, you know, see your health reports, and then it's just somebody tagging along like doing- Yeah, you have like a folder and as they're sitting there talking you're like filling out pay pork Yep, that sounds like yep All right Genova and medical practitioner you both see as somebody materializes Yeah! As somebody materializes in between both of you. Reality anchor? Um... Materializes. Uh, isn't this real life though? Yes. Okay, so this individual, I'm going to describe this individual for you. She is, um, she has beautiful long green dark hair, golden yellow eyes. She is wearing a white strapless dress and- Standing up, I immediately pull out a fire crystal and hold Lady Light close before backing up in a defensive manner. She gestures and shows that her hands are empty. And she taps the blank page. She doesn't say a word. This is what she looks like by the way for our friend. I'm posting a picture in the chat. Wow. I was imagining like nuclear like green so green that it's oh like a biohazard green yeah like a biohazard green like it's such a hazard that I have to like put my clipboard up kind of green. That's what I was imagining. Um, she- I'm gonna look at the blank paper for slowly offering a pencil. She kind of looks at you for a minute. She goes, I can speak. I just didn't know if you wanted me to be quiet. What do you want? I want the foundation to stop experimenting on me. They have worked very hard to clone my essence into the simulation and it's causing me pain. I... How is somebody supposed to react to that? Like me and my situation, I'm a medical practitioner with a clipboard in hand, somebody materializes in front and talks about a simulation. Um, and... Hmm. Sorry, is it still their turn? No, there's no turns. There's no turns? She goes, says the one that was just in the simulation room, taking these individuals out of it. Says the one who works for the foundation who has been experimenting on me. Looking at the green-haired woman, I simply ask, why should I help you, Realmwalker? shouldn't. You don't have to. You have the free will to say no. And I know that they, the corrupted version of me, that they cloned has harmed those that love you. I want to make it up to you. Yes. Hello? Yes. They have cloned me into their- I quickly pulled out the note before looking at some of the blood that I had wiped off my hand. Okay. I assume the note that I picked up from the overseer's chair got blood on it because I still had blood on my hands. Yes, it did. It's sparkly. And it's dry. You've never actually told me what repercussions I would have suffered because Genova actually licked and ingested some of the overseas blood. You did not tell me that? Um... Yes, I did. I said I licked some of the blood off my hand before looking back at the chair. Oh, God. Oh, God. I need to... Just give me a second. Quickly looking around the room assuming there are cameras and stuff. I look back at the woman in green with the green hair and say... Alright. Um... I need ya. Something's gonna happen. I need answers. I feel like you're the only one who's gonna give me......anything. And you're asking the green-haired individual? I'm saying this to the green-haired individual. She goes, I'm an open book as far as I can be. I know my brother's out here looking for me. I have questions, but I don't think now is the right time to ask. In my home, which I don't even know if it was real anymore, we had mages who were able to and spirits who are able to bind themselves to an individual. They disappear from the material plane, but follow and commune with a chosen individual. And the thing at the start... I don't understand, I'm just an individual that I sacrificed myself, like I chose to be here because I have an extraordinary ability and I was getting harassed and threatened because of it. And I thought the foundation would keep me safe. Is your current form corporeal? Ah, no. Hey Luna, is it okay if I pull something out really quick, just in this really emotional time? Go ahead. Alright, I don't understand what the hell happened and why in the hell did somebody just materialize in front of me. And what is this about clones? You, since you are a low ranking staff member, you have not been informed, but you do know that the simulation overseer was doing a lot of experiments with the personas and trying to figure out what makes 6858 tick. When you open your little iPad device and you type in 6858, it pulls up her profile and it's a spitting image of who's in front of you. Oh, okay. Uh, is there a big report button next to it? No, it says that this entity is considered safe. Okay, I was like, I thought it wasn't considered safe for a second. I'm like, give me a minute to think about what I could say about this. Sorry. You know of some very strange happenings, but You have never experienced a loot euclid or keter object that has ever risked your life because you've been just helping with the medical. By the way, Luna, I'm very versed in SCP foundations stuff. The only thing I'm not very good at is Star Rail or other. So yeah. There's like zero. This isn't an actual SCP. Is the actual 6858 is like a French Canadian werewolf? The fuck? The actual SCP-685- So this is a concept? This is not a real SCP is what I'm saying. This is made specifically for this story. It took me a while to figure that out so I spent a lot of time reading the story of SCP-6858 which is just a French Canadian wolf man Yep, and wondering how to spit into it doesn't it doesn't Also all the overseers are different and a bunch of like the lore behind the overseers and personas and photoners is different Just because I had to make them all fit huh There is no dr. Sherman of sight 42. You don't know that kind of stuff I mean, technically Dr. Sherman has been known even in the uh... You've never been to Site 42 have you? Site... sorry the SCP-0 contamination uh... story has been known to travel between different sites. So who's talking about a dude on YouTube under the Site 42 YouTube channel who takes the name of Dr. Sherman and talks shit in World War 9? Oh, yeah, no, Emberfall is in fact an actual site in my story that you could visit He talked about 049 using the gender switching stone and hey, alright, let's get back on let's get back on topic about our campaign anyway Can I look inside my bag of crystals for what appears for anything that appears to be empty Like what? Like a crystal that does not appear to have an actual element tied to it. No, there's none. They all have elements. Hey Luna, one more question. Sorry. Do I have a cup of coffee in my hand? I'm sorry. If you say coffee please, you know that the robot bartender will give you one. Okay, I had a really funny idea, but alright. She also puts two glasses near you when you ask. She puts a coffee and she puts what appears to be a, um, like a like a blue bull can. A blue pan? No, a blue bull can. A blue red bull can or? No, a blue bull can. a blue bull can yeah what in the it's a known energy drink it's a it's a known energy drink in your world okay legally distinct red bull all right she puts that right next to your coffee I was just gonna take a sip of it and say this is about my prep and that's all I'm gonna say I'm gonna look at the woman then down to myself before going is there another way you and I can meet face to face privately? I mean is your room private? I don't know what I mean. I do have a roommate, but... Who's your roommate? I think she's mine for you. Yeah, I've got Genesis, remember? But you have your own separate room, too. Like, you're choosing to roommate. But you have a space that's designated as yours. Like, you have a key and all. Cause you and Lady Light like to come and visit and just chat. I assumed. Looking at six eight five eight. I both of you breath perception checks Standard yes Dirty 20 all right, and you Kobashi What do I do that roll a d20 and just tell me the number on the d20 Alright, I got the D20. Alright, what did you roll? Alright, give it a minute. 14. You both hear tssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss Yeah, she uh, yeah, they look firmly like how they should be they look really fresh actually I'm getting message lock eyes with the simulation overseer here, but I don't, I make sure that said individual cannot read my emotions or what, or anything I'm doing. Okay. Oh, I have to roll for the stone eye. Is there a table for the, oh, hold up one moment. Yeah, okay. That's what I thought happened if that happened to you, but I wasn't sure. Okay. I also hide away the note and try to make it look like I don't have dried blood on my hands. Okay. Yeah. Absolutely. Uh, she nods. Finally addressing the overseer I simply ask... Are you holding up? Okay, I need you to roll a perception check with advantage. 18. You see her tapping her finger. You notice it's Morris Code. says in the Morris Code can't speak, can hear, stuck. I decide to tap back. She like nods her head no. And she taps speak. I can hear. Are you holding up? Denuinly, because... You were messed up pretty bad. She nods, yes. And then taps. Severe head damage. Possible Perniment. And, uh, generic medical professional here, you're trained in, like, different languages and Morris Code is one of those languages because you know that all of the overseers are capable of speaking that particular version of Morris Code. Is there tapping Morris Code? Yeah, she's tapping Morris Code. Uh, you have access to her charts if you want to pull them up? Yes, that would be great. One moment please. Alright, give me a second here. Oh wow, it's taking its sweet time. Okay, I asked Claude to make me a medical chart for you. Looking at the overseer? My god is a... Looking at the overseer? I simply ask... Those aren't simulations we're going to. Are they? Okay, I can't actually... I'm getting censored by the model. But basically... Are you just using uncensored OLM? using Claude, which is supposed to be a medical LLN. Okay, so I'm going to resolve medical professional real quick just so that we can stay in order here. You pull up the chart and you see six counts of extreme brain damage, mostly towards the back of the head, multiple broken bones. The right eye is severely injured and you notice that they've been given a cocktail of medications to reduce the amount of pain. There is a note on the chart that says possible visit to the returning overseer. And my plan is to possibly get her out of the city or to get her away from the overseer or is that- No, you know that visits to the returning overseer result in a new overseer returning to the position. Okay. Are either of you all weirded out by like, like, voluntary, voluntary, like, suicide? I am not weirded out. Okay, basically a overseer- So basically an overseer can visit the returning overseer and voluntarily give up their life to return as a different incarnation of that overseer. So my plan is to get them away from the overseer is what makes sense. Okay, cool. No. You have no plan or a course of action at this time. It's just a note that they can opt to go to the returning overseer. That's it. That's all. Alright, Jenova, what did you say you wanted to do? I simply asked the overseer, those aren't simulations we're going into, are they? They tilt their head and point towards their head and then they go, I don't under stand. As their eye kind of twitches a little bit. You can tell that they are in extreme pain. blonde hair kind of like under the bandages their blonde hair still kind of sparkles but it's it's kind of faded sparkling. The inner simulation is to be in a malleable dream. There is a feeling of disconnect, a feeling of perfection and endlessness. Hey, blue. Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, sorry. No, go ahead. I'm trying to translate the Morse code. That's all. Do what? No, you fully understand it. You just understand it as English. And if you don't, there's a little app on your iPad. Genova isn't speaking Morse code. She's speaking common. So, me, as to like me in real life, like currently speaking to you as I, I could, I can't understand. Neither can I. So that's why I'm just saying it aloud and just tapping my desk. Oh, no, I thought they were like saying it and then in the middle of saying it, they're like trying to, they were trying to beat that like, uh. No, they were. So the simulation number C here hasn't said a word yet. She's just been tapping. Yeah. But Genova has been openly speaking. Careful, you're dangerously close to a racial insult. You scuffed it. Anyway, you don't hear what I'm tapping. I'm tapping SOS, but it's fine. It sounded like you were tapping something else that started with an S that almost drifted to a racial insult. Uh-huh. So, um, I cannot... Anyway, as Genova was saying, a simulation is like a dream you can fully control, but there is always a feeling of disconnect, a feeling of perfection. These simulations we've been going into, they don't feel like that. They feel more like the real world than this supposed reality. So I ask again, they are not simulations, are they? She kinda just looks very confused. She looks over at the barkeep and taps out more meds, please. Because the barkeep brings over a tall glass of water and a cup full of medication. You don't have the answers I seek, do you? Does the medical professional want to open up and tell them about the extreme brain damage she has right now? Do you want to tell Jenova about the brain damage of the simulation overseer and how she might just be confused? Okay, what is Jenova's expression like right now? Very confused. Oh, very confused. Oh, he's calculated. I break it in the best way possible by like, by like trying to say it very slowly, like like normal doctors do and TV shows like you have brain damage. Are you saying that to Genova? Genova? Is it that how it is? Is Genova? No, Genova doesn't have brain damage. simulation overseer does oh yeah no she took six hits to the head and like the whole back part of her head was destroyed practically simulation that's why she's tapping because it hit the language center like the vocal center Nova is trying to grill the overseer for information but the overseer probably is sustained sustained so much damage that they can't comprehend the extensive words jenova is using you realize midnight that I probably caused this in my evil reign haha I'm sorry what no you're good you were playing a character it's all good you also weren't evil job okay okay so they're trying to grill the overseer in Morris code so can No, in common. They're speaking in common. You also hear a quiet breathing on your shoulder as Lady Light has actually fallen asleep. And she's very comfy. Uh... Uh... Jenova. Figured. Every truckin' pet Lady Light's head. Her purple hair sparkles when you pet it. Alright, you were saying? Medical professional? I just completely tell them everything I have. That's totally it. Okay. You show them the chart? And the second thing I do is after I show them the chart, I go back to my coffee and I take a sip and I say I don't get paid for this. So is here where I point out that Jenova comes from a world of fantasy and dragons so she wouldn't exactly know how to read a chart but she would understand the fact that the overseer has brain damage? Yes. You have seen people sustain damage and then lose faculties before. Yeah. Jenova understands brain damage. The woman next to you. Yeah, but the technology of the entire facility is alien to her. It's very magical. It is very magical to you. Not even magical. She's seen magic. This is alien. This is like a higher level of magic than you are used to seeing. I reiterate, alien. So how do you react to being shown the, uh, the chart though? Like, does that make sense why she's not responding to you? Awe's tilt her head and then look at the medical personnel. I don't quite understand what I'm looking at. There is some pretty extensive language and I did not realize tablets of stone and steel could emit light like this. You've seen light and darks or twilight's translation tablet. That's different from like a technological tablet, isn't it? It's exactly the same. They're both iPads. You made it sound like it was a magic stone. It's to you. To you. It looks like a magic stone. I was imagining an egg-shaped orb. No, I said a flat rectangular, like, stone tablet that looks silverish. And it goes, ba-doop! when he presses it. It's all good. I was gonna look over the medical professional. I Do not comprehend these Foreign magics and technologies you Perform with Though it is clear to see that the overseer has sustained severe cranial damage I've seen more than my share in my Royal Knights The simulation adversary looks at all four of you. And taps is it my time. Not even consulting the medical staff, Jadova just hands the tablet to the overseer before walking past carrying Lady Light. I will never understand how you all treat death so lightly. So... Laughably. Your time should be your choice. Would you wish to heal and recover? You should choose. Until then, this is what I am asking. I wish to rest. Please. Then go rest. I am quite exhausted myself. So I shall take my life and I will go rest in my room. 685A looks at you from the table. Do you wish to come relax and rest as well? I ask 6858. She nods and disappears. I take Lady Light to my personal room, lay her on my bed, and then just sit on the ground with my back against the mattress. Oh, there's like chairs and stuff in your room. I like sitting on the floor. In one of the chairs 6858 will appear, but I want to make sure that both of you are comfy before we Split up and look for clues type of thing So I'm actually going to say this is where I have to call it because I've got dishes to do and I'm pretty tired. Good good good, but I wanted you to have a look at my notes first okay, well, I'm gonna stop the audio recording and and gonna go ahead and start that processing of the transcript.
